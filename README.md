# Tools

This archive keeps track of some the common configuration and customization files I use to configure my working environment. Some of the scripts are universal - they're either templates, configurations, or other portable files that should seamlessly integrate into working environments on different machines. Others are specifically tagged as working on different machines.

The script `link_me` will create symbolic links to all the scripts in `bin/` in your user `~/bin/` directory.
