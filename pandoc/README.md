# A template for writing simple documents in Markdown for later conversion to $\LaTeX$

**February 15, 2015**

## How To Use

You can use any general Markdown file. This package just pre-defines a `Makefile` and some customizable templates which you can hack to simplify the process of generating pretty articles from your Markdown file.

## Credits
